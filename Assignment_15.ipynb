    "Ans : 5 Examples of Classification Problems : Logistic regression : Logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable. ... It is one of the simplest ML algorithms that can be used for various classification problems such as spam detection, Diabetes prediction, cancer detection etc. Decision trees : Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Machine Learning (that is you explain what the input is and what the corresponding output is in the training data) where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter. The tree can be explained by two entities, namely decision nodes and leaves. Random forest : Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems. It builds decision trees on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification and average in case of regression. It performs better results for classification problems. XGBoost : XGBoost is an algorithm that has recently been dominating applied machine learning and Kaggle competitions for structured or tabular data. XGBoost is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance.Why XGBoost must be a part of your machine learning toolkit. Light GBM : Light Gradient Boosted Machine, or LightGBM for short, is an open-source library that provides an efficient and effective implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm."

A classifier in machine learning is an algorithm that automatically orders or categorizes data into one or more of a set of “classes.” One of the most common examples is an email classifier that scans emails to filter them by class label: Spam or Not Spam. The main goal of the Classification algorithm is to identify the category of a given dataset, and these algorithms are mainly used to predict the output for the categorical data. Multi-class Classifier: If a classification problem has more than two outcomes, then it is called as Multi-class Classifier."

SVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems. It can solve linear and non-linear problems and work well for many practical problems. The idea of SVM is simple: The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes."

SVM is effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. SVM is relatively memory efficient. Disadvantages: SVM algorithm is not suitable for large data sets. SVM does not perform very well when the data set has more noise i.e. target classes are overlapping. In cases where the number of features for each data point exceeds the number of training data samples, the SVM will underperform."
