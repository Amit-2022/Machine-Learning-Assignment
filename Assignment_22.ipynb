In statistical terms, the predicted target label of the ensemble is the mode of the distribution of individually predicted labels. In soft voting, every individual classifier provides a probability value that a specific data point belongs to a particular target class. The predictions are weighted by the classifier's importance and summed up. Then the target label with the greatest sum of weighted probabilities wins the vote."
